# TensorFlow-Object-detection

Use of ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco as implementation of a tensorflow model for object detection purpose. The satndard COCO trained dataset is taken and implemented to detect and put a bounding box around the obect showing the name of what the machine is trained to think it is. The inference .pb file is pre-trained and labeled frozen inference file which is labeled and trained on a google's COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset which again is used for implementing the trained dataset on a live webcam feed
